## Jupyter Notebooks

To make it simpler to follow complex guides, it's being documented in the Jupyter Notebook format.

- [RISCV environment with Qemu](https://github.com/fede2cr/riscv_playground/blob/master/RISCV%20Qemu.en.ipynb): It creates a development environment with Qemu-riscv. Used for developement of the Slackware-RISCV64 distribution.
- [Sandsifter](https://github.com/fede2cr/riscv_playground/blob/master/CPU%20Sandsifter.ipynb): Searched for hidden instructions in x86-64 CPUs, finding **millons** of non-documented instructions. This should be motivation enough to move to open arquitectures.
